        <h2>Discription</h2>
        <p>This is a creamy, hearty dip that works well for a gathering. It's not light, and is a good option when you are serving close to meal time, but don't want to prepare a full meal. I serve this with multigrain tortilla scoops.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>2 cooked chicken breasts, shredded</li>
            <li>½ cup buffalo wing sauce</li>
            <li>¼ cup ranch salad dressing</li>
            <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package scoop-shaped tortilla chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Mix cream cheese, chicken, buffalo wing sauce, ranch dressing, and sour cream together in a large bowl; transfer to a 9x13-inch baking dish. Evenly sprinkle Colby-Monterey Jack cheese over dip.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve with tortilla chips.</li>
        </ol>
