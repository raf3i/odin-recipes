        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 ½ pounds beef sirloin, cut into 1/4-inch wide strips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 cup mushrooms</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups chilled beef stock</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shake 1 tablespoon flour with salt in a large, resealable plastic bag until combined; add beef and shake to coat.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Brown beef in the hot butter, about 3 minutes per side. Stir mushrooms, onion, and garlic into beef; cook and stir until garlic is fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer beef and vegetables to a bowl, leaving drippings in skillet.</li>
            <li>Melt 2 more tablespoons butter in skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir 3 tablespoons flour in the hot butter until smooth; stir tomato paste into flour mixture. Whisk beef stock into mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return beef and vegetables to skillet and stir to coat with sauce. Reduce heat to very low and simmer until beef is tender, 2 to 3 hours. The longer it cooks, the more tender the meat will be. Just before serving, stir sour cream and white wine into beef mixture and heat through. Do not boil.</li>
